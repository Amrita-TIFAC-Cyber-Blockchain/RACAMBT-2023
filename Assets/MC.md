Sunsets are proofs that endings can be beautiful.
The end of one chapter marks the beginning of another.
Read on because there is something enticing in every chapter. As we conclude our today's session let's pin up in our minds Colombus's words....
"You can never cross the ocean unless you have the courage to lose sight of  the shore."
Let's keep our minds motivated and souls passionate...
Thanking each and everyone of you !!
Goodnight!
